# Code to Text Tool

`code-to-text.py` extracts folder structure and file contents from a directory and saves them into a text file. It excludes common unwanted files and directories (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`).

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python code-to-text.py
   ```

2. Enter:
   - Folder path.
   - Output file name (e.g., `output.txt`).

3. The output file will contain:
   - Folder structure.
   - Code file contents (excluding unwanted files).
